oh hi guys

This site uses npm, Webpack, React, Sass, and Babel in addition to stuff like Materialize CSS, Material Icons and Google Fonts.

You might say this is overkill for a simple portfolio site, and I would agree with you.
Part of the reason I'm building this is to get experience building in this kind of environment as opposed to Codepen, though, so here we are.
